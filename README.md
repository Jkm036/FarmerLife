# FarmerLife
This is a game that incorporates AI NPC dialgoue written 100% in pure java.
It incorporates components of the Java.awt library, Java.swing library A\* search algroithm , rotational matrix math and basic game development principles.
In this project I incorporated building the game engine and the game itself.
It's a game about collecting wheat as a farmer. Iplan to expand the game however the main functionality is pretty much complete and the rest is just polishing the game to actually be entertaining.
